LEAM
====

LEAM can take LameStation games written with the LameStation SDK and turn them into games that can be run on your desktop.

Want to share your awesome game with your friends but they don't have a LameStation? No problem! LEAM it up!

It's pronounced LEEEEEEM! It's like Steam for LameStation. I think.

LEAM isn't exactly a recursive acronym that standards for "LEAM isn't Exactly An eMulator."
